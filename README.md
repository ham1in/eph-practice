# Eph Practice
Practice implementations of simple models, such as Holstein. 

To do: Write notes for CCSD-S1-1 and necessary equations to compute the band-structure in the Holstein model.

I would one day like to implement an automated equation generator for Coupled Cluster, so that I can validate that the expressions I am deriving are indeed correct.
